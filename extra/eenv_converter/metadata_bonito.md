### Jogging (folder jogging_mixed)
- based on paper
  - 2 participants with each: 2x piezo at the ankles, 1x pv at the wrist
  - jogging in a public park (with short walking and standing breaks)
- based on file `meta.yml`
  - nodes powered by powerbanks
  - synchronization via GPS
  - pv model: IXYS KXOB25-05X3F
  - piezo model: Mide S128-J1FR-1808YB
  - early afternoon, spring time, central european city
  - intermittent walking/running
  - participants f(29y), m(29y)
  - sheep0: piezo, left ankle
  - sheep1: solar, left wrist
  - sheep2: piezo, right ankle
  - sheep3: piezo, left ankle
  - sheep4: solar, left wrist
  - sheep5: piezo, right ankle
- based on file `notes`
  - sheep0,1,2 on person 0
  - sheep3,4,5 on person 1
- anwered by Kai
  - Precise Location: H942+CX Berlin
  - Route: https://maps.app.goo.gl/qjWAJeZZfLec4cCE8 (there and back)

### Stairs (folder data_step)
- based on paper
  - 7 pv embedded into an outdoor stair in front of a lecture hall
  - frequent foot traffic causes intermittent shadowing
- based on video `2020-01-16-105730`
  - Date: 16.01.2020 (from filename; Jan 16 from video)
  - Time: end at 13:19 (at timestamp 02:24) => start at ~10:55; 10:57:30 from filename
  - All nodes on the edge of the 2nd step (going by black strip)
  - Sun low, long shadows of trees moving slowly from right to left
  - People use the stairs (low/medium traffic, walking normally, not lingering)
  - Solid shadow (likely from a building) covers nodes towards the end
    - starts moving in from the right at timestamp 01:36
    - covers the entire black strip by 02:05
    - afterwards refractions from the fence cause minor illumination?

  - Date: 11.05.2021 (from filename `IMG_20210511_124937.jpg`) => verified from unix timestamp
  - connected via switch (PoE)
  - one node top left of the front side -> sheep2
  - one node top right of the front side
  - no node on the door!
  - one node top middle of the right side -> sheep3
  - one node (front?) middle of the top side -> sheep0
